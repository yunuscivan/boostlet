# Boostlet – Intelligent Resource Optimizer ( including its website )

Boostlet is a lightweight desktop utility that helps users regain system performance when CPU and RAM usage gets high.  It's designed to act only when necessary, not to run permanently in the background. ( now only the Windows version ) Downloadable from its website !

While working in e-commerce, I was looking for a solution to frequent slowdowns on my computer. I developed Boostlet for the personal project assignment in Powercoders Bootcamp thinking about this problem — using basic Python knowledge, open-source resources, and AI tools such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and DeepSeek.

Boostlet can be useful on devices in certain situations:

Systems with 8 GB RAM or more that have been running for hours, PCs frequently using heavy browsers (e.g., Chrome with many tabs) or background tools, office laptops running multiple apps (Teams, Excel, Outlook, etc.) simultaneously, developers’ machines using IDEs, emulators or virtual machines, any system experiencing gradual slowdown over time due to memory fragmentation.

## Key Features

- **Manual & Automatic Cleaning: Clean memory with one click ( on the window or on system tray in Windows ), or let Boostlet react automatically when usage thresholds are exceeded.
- **Deep RAM Cleaning: Optionally frees cached and standby memory for deeper optimization.
- **Threshold-Based Triggers: Set custom CPU and RAM thresholds that define when Boostlet should act.
- **Interval Mode: Schedule RAM cleanup every X minutes, acting like an automatic background cleaner.
- **System Info View: Displays CPU model, OS, RAM amount, and uptime.
- **Tray Mode: Keep Boostlet active in the background with right-click tray access.

## 💻 Interface Overview

### Main Window
- Set CPU/RAM thresholds
- Choose between:
  -  Alert mode (ask before cleaning)
  -  Auto-clean mode (clean directly)
- Enable deep cleaning and interval cleaning
- View current CPU and RAM usage
- Access system info
- Click “Clean RAM Now” any time

### Tray Menu
- Show/hide window
- Clean RAM instantly
- Exit application

> Tip: “Clean RAM Now” works even if neither Alert nor Auto-clean is selected.

---

## Recommended Settings

- Set CPU and RAM thresholds to ~80%
- Use Alert Mode if you prefer manual control
- Use Auto-clean Mode for hands-free optimization
- Use Interval Mode for scheduled maintenance (disables thresholds)

---

## How It Works

1. Boostlet monitors CPU and RAM usage.
2. When user-defined thresholds are exceeded:
   - It either alerts the user, or cleans RAM automatically.
3. The cleaning process trims memory from running processes (working sets).
4. Optional: It performs deep cleaning using an external tool (`EmptyStandbyList.exe`) to release cached memory.

### Ram Cleaning and How

Boostlet uses Python's ctypes module to call Windows API functions that empty the working sets of running processes.Working sets are portions of a process's memory that are currently resident in physical RAM.

When a process does not use some of its memory pages frequently, those pages can be pushed out (cleaned) from RAM, freeing up space for other active processes.

It requires administrator privileges.

## What is `EmptyStandbyList.exe`? ( Deep Ram Cleaning Feature )

`EmptyStandbyList.exe` is a lightweight utility used to clear the standby memory list on Windows systems. Standby memory consists of cached pages that are no longer actively in use but are still held in RAM.

Boostlet uses this tool optionally when Deep RAM Cleaning is enabled. It requires administrator privileges.

This tool is open-source and originally provided by Wj32 (https://wj32.org/wp/software/empty-standby-list/). It is included in Boostlet for convenience and transparency.

⚠️ Important Note:  
> If you run the `.exe` file directly (e.g. from GitHub or by copying it alone), the system tray icon may not appear correctly when clicking "Close Window" or "Close" — because the icon file (`boostlet.ico`) is missing.  
> For full functionality (especially tray visibility), make sure to keep the `.exe` file together with all related assets (like the icon file) in the same directory.


I hope you liked the app and its website! Do not forget to send your feedback on the website ! And this is the very first version of the tool, I am planing to add another features like being able to see the apps, which have the highest CPU and RAM load ( and also with a kill function maybe ) and more ! The MacOS and mobile versions are coming soon...Thanks!
