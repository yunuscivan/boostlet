        <strong>üîç What is Boostlet?</strong><br>
        Boostlet is a lightweight desktop tool that helps you regain system performance when CPU and RAM usage gets high. It's designed to act <em>only when necessary</em>, not to run permanently in the background.
        <br><br>

        <strong>üß† When should I use it?</strong><br>
        Use Boostlet during performance drops ‚Äî for example, when your RAM usage goes beyond 80% and things slow down. It‚Äôs made for <strong>controlled cleanups</strong>, not constant background activity.
        <br><br>

        <strong>‚öôÔ∏è Key Features:</strong><br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>CPU/RAM Thresholds:</strong> Set usage limits that trigger action.<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>Alert vs Auto-Clean:</strong> Choose whether Boostlet should ask you first or act automatically.<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>RAM Cleaning:</strong> Releases unused memory from running processes to improve responsiveness.<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>Deep RAM Cleaning:</strong> Clears cached and standby memory for deeper optimization.<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>Interval Mode:</strong> Run RAM cleanups automatically every X minutes (acts as auto-mode).<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>System Info:</strong> View your system specs and uptime.<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>Tray Mode:</strong> Keep Boostlet active in the background with right-click access to functions.
        <br><br>

        <strong>üñ±Ô∏è Quick Access Tips:</strong><br>
        ‚Äì The <strong>Clean RAM Now</strong> button works instantly, even if Alert or Auto-Clean is not selected.<br>
        ‚Äì You can right-click the Boostlet tray icon and select <em>"Clean RAM Now"</em> at any time.<br>
        ‚Äì When <strong>Interval Mode</strong> is enabled, Boostlet automatically performs cleaning at scheduled times without requiring other settings to be active.
        <br><br>

        <strong>‚úÖ Recommended Settings:</strong><br>
        ‚Äì Set both CPU and RAM thresholds around 80%.<br>
        ‚Äì Use <strong>Alert</strong> mode if you want to be notified first.<br>
        ‚Äì Use <strong>Auto-Clean</strong> for hands-free optimization.<br>
        ‚Äì Enable <strong>Interval Mode</strong> if you want scheduled cleanup without threshold checks.
